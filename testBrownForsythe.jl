# The transformed response variable is constructed to measure the spread in each group. Let

# zij = |yij - medianyj|


# where medianyj is the median of group j. The Brownâ€“Forsythe test statistic is the model F statistic from a one way ANOVA on zij:


# F = (N-p)/(p-1) * sumjtop * nj(meanz.j - median z..) * power2 / sumjtop * sumitonj * (zij - median.j) * power2


# where p is the number of groups, nj is the number of observations in group j, and N is the total number of observations. Also meanz.j are the group means of the zij and median z.. is the overall mean of the zij. This F-statistic follows the F-distribution with degrees of freedom d1 = p - 1 and d2 = N - p under the null hypothesis.
